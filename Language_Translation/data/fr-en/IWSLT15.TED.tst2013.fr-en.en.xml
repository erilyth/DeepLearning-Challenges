<description>When most well-intentioned aid workers hear of a problem they think they can fix, they go to work. This, Ernesto Sirolli suggests, is naïve. In this funny and impassioned talk, he proposes that the first step is to listen to the people you're trying to help, and tap into their own entrepreneurial spirit. His advice on what works will help any entrepreneur.</description>

<title>Ernesto Sirolli: Want to help someone? Shut up and listen!</title>
<seg id="1"> Everything I do, and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa. </seg>
<seg id="2"> From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young, but I'm not — -- I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Ivory Coast, Algeria, Somalia, in projects of technical cooperation with African countries. </seg>
<seg id="3"> I worked for an Italian NGO, and every single project that we set up in Africa failed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And I was distraught. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I thought, age 21, that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Instead, everything we touched we killed. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Our first project, the one that has inspired my first book, "Ripples from the Zambezi," was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food. </seg>
<seg id="8"> So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River, and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ... </seg>
<seg id="9"> And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that, so we paid them to come and work, and sometimes they would show up. </seg>
<seg id="10"> And we were amazed that the local people, in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything, we simply said, "Thank God we're here." </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation." </seg>
<seg id="13"> And of course, everything in Africa grew beautifully. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians, "Look how easy agriculture is." </seg>
<seg id="16"> When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red, overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And we said to the Zambians, "My God, the hippos!" </seg>
<seg id="18"> And the Zambians said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Why didn't you tell us?" "You never asked." </seg>
<seg id="20"> I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa, but then I saw what the Americans were doing, what the English were doing, what the French were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I became quite proud of our project in Zambia. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Because, you see, at least we fed the hippos. </seg>
<seg id="22"> You should see the rubbish — -- You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> You want to read the book, read "Dead Aid," by Dambisa Moyo, Zambian woman economist. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The book was published in 2009. </seg>
<seg id="25"> We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Just go and read her book. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Read it from an African woman, the damage that we have done. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We Western people are imperialist, colonialist missionaries, and there are only two ways we deal with people: We either patronize them, or we are paternalistic. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The two words come from the Latin root "pater," which means "father." </seg>
<seg id="31"> But they mean two different things. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Paternalistic, I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children. "I love you so much." </seg>
<seg id="33"> Patronizing, I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants. </seg>
<seg id="34"> That's why the white people in Africa are called "bwana," boss. </seg>
<seg id="35"> I was given a slap in the face reading a book, "Small is Beautiful," written by Schumacher, who said, above all in economic development, if people do not wish to be helped, leave them alone. </seg>
<seg id="36"> This should be the first principle of aid. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The first principle of aid is respect. </seg>
<seg id="38"> This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor, and said, "Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial?" </seg>
<seg id="39"> I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people, and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation, where you never initiate anything, you never motivate anybody, but you become a servant of the local passion, the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person. </seg>
<seg id="40"> So what you do -- you shut up. </seg>
<seg id="41"> You never arrive in a community with any ideas, and you sit with the local people. </seg>
<seg id="42"> We don't work from offices. </seg>
<seg id="43"> We meet at the cafe. We meet at the pub. </seg>
<seg id="44"> We have zero infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="45"> And what we do, we become friends, and we find out what that person wants to do. </seg>
<seg id="46"> The most important thing is passion. </seg>
<seg id="47"> You can give somebody an idea. </seg>
<seg id="48"> If that person doesn't want to do it, what are you going to do? </seg>
<seg id="49"> The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing. </seg>
<seg id="51"> And then we help them to go and find the knowledge, because nobody in the world can succeed alone. </seg>
<seg id="52"> The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available. </seg>
<seg id="53"> So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why don't we, for once, instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do, why don't, for once, listen to them? But not in community meetings. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Let me tell you a secret. </seg>
<seg id="55"> There is a problem with community meetings. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Entrepreneurs never come, and they never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity they have identified. </seg>
<seg id="57"> So planning has this blind spot. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The smartest people in your community you don't even know, because they don't come to your public meetings. </seg>
<seg id="59"> What we do, we work one-on-one, and to work one-on-one, you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn't exist. </seg>
<seg id="60"> You have to create a new profession. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The profession is the family doctor of enterprise, the family doctor of business, who sits with you in your house, at your kitchen table, at the cafe, and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living. </seg>
<seg id="62"> I started this as a tryout in Esperance, in Western Australia. </seg>
<seg id="63"> I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do. </seg>
<seg id="64"> And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets, and in three days I had my first client, and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage, was a Maori guy, and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth, to get organized, and then the fishermen came to me to say, "You the guy who helped Maori? Can you help us?" </seg>
<seg id="65"> And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo, but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo, and the farmers came to talk to me, said, "Hey, you helped them. Can you help us?" </seg>
<seg id="66"> In a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to see me to say, "How can you do that? </seg>
<seg id="67"> How can you do — ?" And I said, "I do something very, very, very difficult. </seg>
<seg id="68"> I shut up, and listen to them." </seg>
<seg id="69"> So — — So the government says, "Do it again." </seg>
<seg id="70"> We've done it in 300 communities around the world. </seg>
<seg id="71"> We have helped to start 40,000 businesses. </seg>
<seg id="72"> There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude. </seg>
<seg id="73"> Peter Drucker, one of the greatest management consultants in history, died age 96, a few years ago. </seg>
<seg id="74"> Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business, and this is what Peter Drucker says: "Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy." </seg>
<seg id="75"> Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship. </seg>
<seg id="76"> So now you're rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy. </seg>
<seg id="77"> You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you. </seg>
<seg id="78"> You have to offer them confidentiality, privacy, you have to be fantastic at helping them, and then they will come, and they will come in droves. </seg>
<seg id="79"> In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, the intelligence and the passion? </seg>
<seg id="81"> Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning? </seg>
<seg id="82"> Local, passionate people. That's who you have applauded. </seg>
<seg id="83"> So what I'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it's at. </seg>
<seg id="84"> We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nonrenewable fossil fuels, manufacturing -- and all of a sudden, we have systems which are not sustainable. </seg>
<seg id="85"> The internal combustion engine is not sustainable. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable. </seg>
<seg id="87"> What we have to look at is at how we feed, cure, educate, transport, communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way. </seg>
<seg id="88"> The technologies do not exist to do that. </seg>
<seg id="89"> Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution? Universities? Forget about it! </seg>
<seg id="90"> Government? Forget about it! </seg>
<seg id="91"> It will be entrepreneurs, and they're doing it now. </seg>
<seg id="92"> There's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many, many years ago. </seg>
<seg id="93"> There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860. </seg>
<seg id="94"> And in 1860, this group of people came together, and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was unanimous: The city of New York would not exist in 100 years. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Why? Because they looked at the curve and said, if the population keeps growing at this rate, to move the population of New York around, they would have needed six million horses, and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with. </seg>
<seg id="96"> They were already drowning in manure. </seg>
<seg id="97"> So 1860, they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York. </seg>
<seg id="98"> So what happens? In 40 years' time, in the year 1900, in the United States of America, there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,001. </seg>
<seg id="99"> The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over, and there were tiny, tiny little factories in backwaters. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Dearborn, Michigan. Henry Ford. </seg>
<seg id="101"> However, there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs. </seg>
<seg id="102"> First, you have to offer them confidentiality. </seg>
<seg id="103"> Otherwise they don't come and talk to you. </seg>
<seg id="104"> Then you have to offer them absolute, dedicated, passionate service to them. </seg>
<seg id="105"> And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship. </seg>
<seg id="106"> The smallest company, the biggest company, has to be capable of doing three things beautifully: The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have fantastic marketing, and you have to have tremendous financial management. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Guess what? </seg>
<seg id="108"> We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it, sell it and look after the money. </seg>
<seg id="109"> It doesn't exist. </seg>
<seg id="110"> This person has never been born. </seg>
<seg id="111"> We've done the research, and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie, Westinghouse, Edison, Ford, all the new companies, Google, Yahoo. </seg>
<seg id="112"> There's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None were started by one person. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland, and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography, and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline, in the first two pages of Richard Branson's autobiography how many times Richard uses the word "I" and how many times he uses the word "we." </seg>
<seg id="114"> Never the word "I," and the word "we" 32 times. </seg>
<seg id="115"> He wasn't alone when he started. </seg>
<seg id="116"> Nobody started a company alone. No one. </seg>
<seg id="117"> So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes, in bars, and your dedicated buddies who will do to you, what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic, somebody who will say to you, "What do you need? </seg>
<seg id="118"> What can you do? Can you make it? </seg>
<seg id="119"> Okay, can you sell it? Can you look after the money?" </seg>
<seg id="120"> "Oh, no, I cannot do this." "Would you like me to find you somebody?" </seg>
<seg id="121"> We activate communities. </seg>
<seg id="122"> We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion, the energy and imagination of your own people. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>What kind of data is your cell phone company collecting? Malte Spitz wasn't too worried when he asked his operator in Germany to share information stored about him. Multiple unanswered requests and a lawsuit later, Spitz received 35,830 lines of code -- a detailed, nearly minute-by-minute account of half a year of his life.</description>

<talkid>1518</talkid>
<title>Malte Spitz: Your phone company is watching</title>
<seg id="1"> Hi. This is my mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="2"> A mobile phone can change your life, and gives you individual freedom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> With a mobile phone, you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria. </seg>
<seg id="4"> With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And with a mobile phone, you can record a song, load it up to SoundCloud and become famous. </seg>
<seg id="6"> All this is possible with your mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I'm a child of 1984, and I live in the city of Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Let's go back to that time, to this city. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change. </seg>
<seg id="10"> This is autumn 1989, and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Who in the room has a mobile phone with you? </seg>
<seg id="12"> Hold it up. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Hold your phones up, hold your phones up! </seg>
<seg id="14"> Hold it up. An Android, a Blackberry, wow. </seg>
<seg id="15"> That's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile phone. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone, and how it changed my life. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And I will talk about this. </seg>
<seg id="18"> These are 35,830 lines of information. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Raw data. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And why are these informations there? </seg>
<seg id="21"> Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission tabled a directive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> This directive [is] called Data Retention Directive. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This directive says that each phone company in Europe, each Internet service company all over Europe, has to store a wide range of information about the users. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Who calls whom? Who sends whom an email? </seg>
<seg id="25"> Who sends whom a text message? </seg>
<seg id="26"> And if you use your mobile phone, where you are. </seg>
<seg id="27"> All this information is stored for at least six months, up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And all over Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this." </seg>
<seg id="29"> They said, we don't want this data retention. </seg>
<seg id="30"> We want self-determination in the digital age, and we don't want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us. </seg>
<seg id="31"> They were lawyers, journalists, priests, they all said: "We don't want this." </seg>
<seg id="32"> And here you can see, like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said, "Freedom, not fear." </seg>
<seg id="33"> And some even said, this would be Stasi 2.0. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Stasi was the secret police in East Germany. </seg>
<seg id="35"> And I also ask myself, does it really work? </seg>
<seg id="36"> Can they really store all this information about us? </seg>
<seg id="37"> Every time I use my mobile phone? </seg>
<seg id="38"> So I asked my phone company, Deutsche Telekom, which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany, and I asked them, please, send me all the information you have stored about me. </seg>
<seg id="39"> And I asked them once, and I asked them again, and I got no real answer. It was only blah blah answers. </seg>
<seg id="40"> But then I said, I want to have this information, because this is my life you are protocoling. </seg>
<seg id="41"> So I decided to start a lawsuit against them, because I wanted to have this information. </seg>
<seg id="42"> But Deutsche Telekom said, no, we will not give you this information. </seg>
<seg id="43"> So at the end, I had a settlement with them. </seg>
<seg id="44"> I'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Because in the mean time, the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional. </seg>
<seg id="46"> So I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.D. inside. </seg>
<seg id="47"> And on the C.D., this was on. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information. </seg>
<seg id="49"> At first I saw it, and I said, okay, it's a huge file. Okay. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But then after a while I realized, this is my life. </seg>
<seg id="51"> This is six months of my life, into this file. </seg>
<seg id="52"> So I was a little bit skeptical, what should I do with it? </seg>
<seg id="53"> Because you can see where I am, where I sleep at night, what I am doing. </seg>
<seg id="54"> But then I said, I want to go out with this information. </seg>
<seg id="55"> I want to make them public. </seg>
<seg id="56"> Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean. </seg>
<seg id="57"> So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City, I did this. </seg>
<seg id="58"> This is a visualization of six months of my life. </seg>
<seg id="59"> You can zoom in and zoom out, you can wind back and fast forward. </seg>
<seg id="60"> You can see every step I take. </seg>
<seg id="61"> And you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne, and how often I call in between. </seg>
<seg id="62"> All this is possible with this information. </seg>
<seg id="63"> That's a little bit scary. </seg>
<seg id="64"> But it is not only about me. </seg>
<seg id="65"> It's about all of us. </seg>
<seg id="66"> First, it's only like, I call my wife and she calls me, and we talk to each other a couple of times. </seg>
<seg id="67"> And then there are some friends calling me, and they call each other. </seg>
<seg id="68"> And after a while you are calling you, and you are calling you, and you have this great communication network. </seg>
<seg id="69"> But you can see how your people are communicating with each other, what times they call each other, when they go to bed. </seg>
<seg id="70"> You can see all of this. </seg>
<seg id="71"> You can see the hubs, like who are the leaders in the group. </seg>
<seg id="72"> If you have access to this information, you can see what your society is doing. </seg>
<seg id="73"> If you have access to this information, you can control your society. </seg>
<seg id="74"> This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran. </seg>
<seg id="75"> This is a blueprint how to survey your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends whom an email, all this is possible if you have access to this information. </seg>
<seg id="76"> And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe, up to two years. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Like I said at the beginning, imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of 1989 had a mobile phone in their pocket. </seg>
<seg id="78"> And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest, and if the Stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it, this may never have happened. </seg>
<seg id="79"> The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [have been] there. </seg>
<seg id="80"> And in the aftermath, also not the fall of the Iron Curtain. </seg>
<seg id="81"> Because today, state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us, online and offline. </seg>
<seg id="82"> They want to have the possibility to track our lives, and they want to store them for all time. </seg>
<seg id="83"> But self-determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction. </seg>
<seg id="84"> But you have to fight for your self-determination today. </seg>
<seg id="85"> You have to fight for it every day. </seg>
<seg id="86"> So, when you go home, tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not outdated. </seg>
<seg id="87"> When you go home, tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information, they don't have to do it. </seg>
<seg id="88"> And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company what information they store about you. </seg>
<seg id="89"> So, in the future, every time you use your mobile phone, let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>Ron Finley plants vegetable gardens in South Central LA -- in abandoned lots, traffic medians, along the curbs. Why? For fun, for defiance, for beauty and to offer some alternative to fast food in a community where "the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys."</description>

<talkid>1685</talkid>
<title>Ron Finley: A guerilla gardener in South Central LA</title>
<seg id="1"> I live in South Central. </seg>
<seg id="2"> This is South Central: liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. </seg>
<seg id="3"> So the city planners, they get together and they figure they're going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else, so they change it to South Los Angeles, like this is going to fix what's really going wrong in the city. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This is South Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Liquor stores, fast food, vacant lots. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Just like 26.5 million other Americans, I live in a food desert, South Central Los Angeles, home of the drive-thru and the drive-by. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Funny thing is, the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys. </seg>
<seg id="8"> People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="9"> For instance, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than, say, Beverly Hills, which is probably eight, 10 miles away. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I got tired of seeing this happening. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And I was wondering, how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food, if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood? </seg>
<seg id="12"> I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars. </seg>
<seg id="13"> I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And I figured, this has to stop. </seg>
<seg id="15"> So I figured that the problem is the solution. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Food is the problem and food is the solution. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn't impregnated with pesticides. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So what I did, I planted a food forest in front of my house. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It's 150 feet by 10 feet. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Thing is, it's owned by the city. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But you have to maintain it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So I'm like, "Cool. I can do whatever the hell I want, since it's my responsibility and I gotta maintain it." </seg>
<seg id="24"> And this is how I decided to maintain it. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So me and my group, L.A. Green Grounds, we got together and we started planting my food forest, fruit trees, you know, the whole nine, vegetables. </seg>
<seg id="26"> What we do, we're a pay-it-forward kind of group, where it's composed of gardeners from all walks of life, from all over the city, and it's completely volunteer, and everything we do is free. </seg>
<seg id="27"> And the garden, it was beautiful. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And then somebody complained. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The city came down on me, and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden, which this citation was turning into a warrant. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And I'm like, "Come on, really? </seg>
<seg id="31"> A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about?" </seg>
<seg id="32"> And I was like, "Cool. Bring it." </seg>
<seg id="33"> Because this time it wasn't coming up. </seg>
<seg id="34"> So L.A. Times got ahold of it. Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman, and one of the Green Grounds members, they put up a petition on Change.org, and with 900 signatures, we were a success. </seg>
<seg id="35"> We had a victory on our hands. </seg>
<seg id="36"> My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we're doing. </seg>
<seg id="37"> I mean, come on, why wouldn't they? </seg>
<seg id="38"> L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns. </seg>
<seg id="39"> They own 26 square miles of vacant lots. </seg>
<seg id="40"> That's 20 Central Parks. </seg>
<seg id="41"> That's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Why in the hell would they not okay this? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Growing one plant will give you 1,000, 10,000 seeds. </seg>
<seg id="44"> When one dollar's worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars' worth of produce. </seg>
<seg id="45"> It's my gospel, when I'm telling people, grow your own food. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Growing your own food is like printing your own money. </seg>
<seg id="47"> See, I have a legacy in South Central. </seg>
<seg id="48"> I grew up there. I raised my sons there. </seg>
<seg id="49"> And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people, and I'm manufacturing my own reality. </seg>
<seg id="50"> See, I'm an artist. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Gardening is my graffiti. I grow my art. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Just like a graffiti artist, where they beautify walls, me, I beautiful lawns, parkways. </seg>
<seg id="53"> I use the garden, the soil, like it's a piece of cloth, and the plants and the trees, that's my embellishment for that cloth. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas. </seg>
<seg id="55"> You just couldn't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people. </seg>
<seg id="56"> So what happened? </seg>
<seg id="57"> I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education, a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood. </seg>
<seg id="58"> To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil. </seg>
<seg id="59"> We are the soil. </seg>
<seg id="60"> You'd be surprised how kids are affected by this. </seg>
<seg id="61"> Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do, especially in the inner city. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Plus you get strawberries. </seg>
<seg id="63"> I remember this time, there was this mother and a daughter came, it was, like, 10:30 at night, and they were in my yard, and I came out and they looked so ashamed. </seg>
<seg id="64"> So I'm like, man, it made me feel bad that they were there, and I told them, you know, you don't have to do this like this. </seg>
<seg id="65"> This is on the street for a reason. </seg>
<seg id="66"> It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry, and this only reinforced why I do this, and people asked me, "Fin, aren't you afraid people are going to steal your food?" </seg>
<seg id="67"> And I'm like, "Hell no, I ain't afraid they're gonna steal it. </seg>
<seg id="68"> That's why it's on the street. </seg>
<seg id="69"> That's the whole idea. </seg>
<seg id="70"> I want them to take it, but at the same time, I want them to take back their health." </seg>
<seg id="71"> There's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="72"> These are the guys, they helped me unload the truck. </seg>
<seg id="73"> It was cool, and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother, and it was just cool to see how this changed them, if it was only for that one moment. </seg>
<seg id="74"> So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens. </seg>
<seg id="75"> We've had, like, 50 people come to our dig-ins and participate, and it's all volunteers. </seg>
<seg id="76"> If kids grow kale, kids eat kale. </seg>
<seg id="77"> If they grow tomatoes, they eat tomatoes. </seg>
<seg id="78"> But when none of this is presented to them, if they're not shown how food affects the mind and the body, they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them. </seg>
<seg id="79"> I see young people and they want to work, but they're in this thing where they're caught up -- I see kids of color and they're just on this track that's designed for them, that leads them to nowhere. </seg>
<seg id="80"> So with gardening, I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities, to have a sustainable life. </seg>
<seg id="81"> And when we do this, who knows? </seg>
<seg id="82"> We might produce the next George Washington Carver. </seg>
<seg id="83"> but if we don't change the composition of the soil, we will never do this. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Now this is one of my plans. This is what I want to do. </seg>
<seg id="85"> I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block. </seg>
<seg id="86"> I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes. </seg>
<seg id="87"> Now don't get me wrong. </seg>
<seg id="88"> I'm not talking about no free shit, because free is not sustainable. </seg>
<seg id="89"> The funny thing about sustainability, you have to sustain it. </seg>
<seg id="90"> What I'm talking about is putting people to work, and getting kids off the street, and letting them know the joy, the pride and the honor in growing your own food, opening farmer's markets. </seg>
<seg id="91"> So what I want to do here, we gotta make this sexy. </seg>
<seg id="92"> So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades, gangstas, gangsta gardeners. </seg>
<seg id="93"> We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is. </seg>
<seg id="94"> If you ain't a gardener, you ain't gangsta. </seg>
<seg id="95"> Get gangsta with your shovel, okay? </seg>
<seg id="96"> And let that be your weapon of choice. </seg>
<seg id="97"> So basically, if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to meet, don't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit. </seg>
<seg id="98"> If you want to meet with me, come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit. </seg>
<seg id="99"> Peace. Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="100"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>Most politicians choose their words carefully, to shape the reality they hope to create. But does it work? Etymologist Mark Forsyth shares a few entertaining word-origin stories from British and American history and draws a surprising conclusion. &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</description>
<keywords>culture,language,politics</keywords>
<talkid>1548</talkid>
<title>Mark Forsyth: What's a snollygoster? A short lesson in political speak</title>
<seg id="1"> One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is "snollygoster." </seg>
<seg id="2"> Just because it sounds so good. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And what snollygoster means is "a dishonest politician." </seg>
<seg id="4"> Although there was a 19th-century newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said, "A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office regardless of party, platform or principle, and who, when he wins, gets there by the sheer force of monumental talknophical assumnancy." </seg>
<seg id="5"> Now I have no idea what "talknophical" is. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Something to do with words, I assume. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But it's very important that words are at the center of politics, and all politicians know they have to try and control language. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It wasn't until, for example, 1771 that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report the exact words that were said in the debating chamber. </seg>
<seg id="9"> And this was actually all down to the bravery of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby, who took on Parliament. </seg>
<seg id="10"> And he was thrown into the Tower of London and imprisoned, but he was brave enough, he was brave enough to take them on, and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And it was only a few years later that we have the first recorded use of the phrase "as bold as brass." </seg>
<seg id="12"> Most people think that's down to the metal. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It's not. It's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want to take you back to the United States of America, just after they'd achieved independence. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington, their leader. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They didn't know. </seg>
<seg id="17"> What do you call the leader of a republican country? </seg>
<seg id="18"> And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table, which might have made it. </seg>
<seg id="20"> I mean, some people wanted him to be called Chief Magistrate Washington, and other people, His Highness George Washington, and other people, Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Not that catchy. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Some people just wanted to call him King. </seg>
<seg id="23"> They thought it was tried and tested. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And they weren't even being monarchical there, they had the idea that you could be elected King for a fixed term. </seg>
<seg id="25"> And, you know, it could have worked. </seg>
<seg id="26"> And everybody got insanely bored, actually, because this debate went on for three weeks. </seg>
<seg id="27"> I read a diary of this poor senator, who just keeps coming back, "Still on this subject." </seg>
<seg id="28"> And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to get drunk on power. </seg>
<seg id="30"> They didn't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest, most pathetic title that they could think of. </seg>
<seg id="32"> And that title was "President." </seg>
<seg id="33"> President. They didn't invent the title. I mean, it existed before, but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It was like the foreman of the jury. </seg>
<seg id="35"> And it didn't have much more grandeur than the term "foreman" or "overseer." </seg>
<seg id="36"> There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title. </seg>
<seg id="37"> And that's why the Senate objected to it. </seg>
<seg id="38"> They said, that's ridiculous, you can't call him President. </seg>
<seg id="39"> This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And who's going to take him seriously if he's got a silly little title like President of the United States of America? </seg>
<seg id="41"> And after three weeks of debate, in the end the Senate did not cave in. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Instead, they agreed to use the title "President" for now, but they also wanted it absolutely set down that they didn't agree with it from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations, whether under republican or monarchical forms of government, whose custom it is to annex, through the office of the Chief Magistrate, titles of respectability -- not bloody President -- and that in the intercourse with foreign nations, the majesty of the people of the United States may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity, i.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Now you can learn three interesting things from this. </seg>
<seg id="44"> First of all -- and this is my favorite -- is that so far as I've ever been able to find out, the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Barack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time, just waiting for the Senate to spring into action. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure -- -- you can still be waiting 223 years later. </seg>
<seg id="47"> But the third thing you can learn, and this is the really important one, this is the point I want to leave you on, is that the title, President of the United States of America, doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it? </seg>
<seg id="48"> Something to do with the slightly over 5,000 nuclear warheads he has at his disposal and the largest economy in the world and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur. </seg>
<seg id="50"> And so the Senate won in the end. </seg>
<seg id="51"> They got their title of respectability. </seg>
<seg id="52"> And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity -- well, it was a singularity back then. </seg>
<seg id="53"> But now, do you know how many nations have a president? </seg>
<seg id="54"> A hundred and forty-seven. </seg>
<seg id="55"> All because they want to sound like the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc. </seg>
<seg id="56"> And so, in the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives lost, because nobody's going to feel that humble when they're told that they are now the President of the United States of America. </seg>
<seg id="57"> And that's the important lesson I think you can take away, and the one I want to leave you with. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality, but in fact, reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Thank you very much. </seg>

<description>Afghan-American artist Aman Mojadidi calls himself "Afghan by blood, redneck by the grace of god." Playing off his two identities, the TED Fellow's bold, funny, thought-provoking artwork explores jihad, gangsterism, consumers and corruption in modern Afghanistan.</description>
<keywords>art,arts,culture,politics</keywords>
<talkid>1539</talkid>
<title>A sense of humor about Afghanistan? Artist Aman Mojadidi shows how</title>
<seg id="1"> So I arrived by truck with about 50 rebels to the battle for Jalalabad as a 19-year-old vegetarian surfer from Jacksonville, Florida. </seg>
<seg id="2"> I traded my Converse black low-tops for a pair of brown leather sandals and launched a rocket towards government tanks that I couldn't even see. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And this was my first time in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Long before that I had grown up with the war, but alongside weekend sleepovers and Saturday soccer games and fistfights with racist children of the Confederacy and religio-nationalist demonstrations chanting, "Down with communism and long live Afghanistan," and burning effigies of Brezhnev before I even knew what it meant. </seg>
<seg id="5"> But this is the geography of self. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And so I stand here today, Afghan by blood, redneck by the grace of God, an atheist and a radically politicized artist who's been living, working and creating in Afghanistan for the last nine years. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now there are a lot of wonderful things that you could make art about in Afghanistan, but personally I don't want to paint rainbows; I want to make art that disturbs identity and challenges authority and exposes hypocrisy and reinterprets reality and even uses kind of an imaginative ethnography to try and understand the world that we live in. </seg>
<seg id="8"> I want to spend a day in the life of a jihadi gangster who wears his jihad against the communists like popstar bling and uses armed religious intimidation and political corruption to make himself rich. </seg>
<seg id="9"> And where else can the jihadi gangster go, but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan: "Vote for me! I've done jihad, and I'm rich." </seg>
<seg id="10"> And try and use this campaign to expose these mafiosos who are masquerading as national heroes. </seg>
<seg id="11"> I want to look into corruption in Afghanistan through a work called "Payback" and impersonate a police officer, set up a fake checkpoint on the street of Kabul and stop cars, but instead of asking them for a bribe, offering them money and apologizing on behalf of the Kabul Police Department -- and hoping that they'll accept this 100 Afghanis on our behalf. </seg>
<seg id="12"> I want to look at how, in my opinion, the conflict in Afghanistan has become conflict chic. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The war and the expatriate life that comes with it have created this environment of style and fashion that can only be described through creating a fashion line for soldiers and suicide bombers where I take local Afghan fox fur and add it to a flack jacket or make multiple interior pockets on fashionable neo-traditional vests. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And I'd like to look at how taking a simple Kabul wheelbarrow and putting it on the wall amidst Kipling's call of 1899 to generate dialogue about how I see contemporary development initiatives being rooted in yesterday's colonial rhetoric about a "white man's burden" to save the brown man from himself and maybe even civilize him a bit. </seg>
<seg id="15"> But doing these things, they can get you in jail, they can be misunderstood, misinterpreted. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But I do them because I have to, because the geography of self mandates it. </seg>
<seg id="17"> That is my burden. What's yours? </seg>
<seg id="18"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>Cameron Russell admits she won "a genetic lottery": she's tall, pretty and an underwear model. But don't judge her by her looks. In this fearless talk, she takes a wry look at the industry that had her looking highly seductive at barely 16-years-old. </description>
<keywords>culture,fashion,photography</keywords>
<talkid>1647</talkid>
<title>Cameron Russell: Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model.</title>
<seg id="1"> Hi. My name is Cameron Russell, and for the last little while I've been a model. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Actually, for 10 years. </seg>
<seg id="3"> And I feel like there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress. </seg>
<seg id="4"> So luckily I brought an outfit change. </seg>
<seg id="5"> This is the first outfit change on the TED stage, so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think. </seg>
<seg id="6"> If some of the women were really horrified when I came out, you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I'd also note that I'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Not everybody gets to do that. </seg>
<seg id="9"> These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The worst part is putting this sweater over my head, because that's when you'll all laugh at me, so don't do anything while it's over my head. </seg>
<seg id="11"> All right. </seg>
<seg id="12"> So why did I do that? </seg>
<seg id="13"> That was awkward. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Well, hopefully not as awkward as that picture. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Image is powerful, but also image is superficial. </seg>
<seg id="16"> I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And in this picture, I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy's hair. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And of course, barring surgery, or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform how we look, and how we look, though it is superficial and immutable, has a huge impact on our lives. </seg>
<seg id="20"> So today, for me, being fearless means being honest. </seg>
<seg id="21"> And I am on this stage because I am a model. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman, and in my industry we call that a sexy girl. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but with an honest twist. </seg>
<seg id="24"> So the first question is, how do you become a model? </seg>
<seg id="25"> And I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted," but that means nothing. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy, and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Well, for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire, but also as tall, slender figures, and femininity and white skin. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And this is a legacy that was built for me, and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on. </seg>
<seg id="29"> And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point, and maybe there are some fashionistas who are, like, "Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen." </seg>
<seg id="30"> And first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007, a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired, and of the 677 models that were hired, only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The next question people always ask me is, "Can I be a model when I grow up?" </seg>
<seg id="33"> And the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that." </seg>
<seg id="34"> But the second answer, and what I really want to say to these little girls is, "Why? </seg>
<seg id="35"> You know? You can be anything. </seg>
<seg id="36"> You could be the President of the United States, or the inventor of the next Internet, or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet, which would be awesome, because you'd be the first one." </seg>
<seg id="37"> If, after this amazing list, they still are like, "No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model," well then I say, "Be my boss." </seg>
<seg id="38"> Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H&amp;M, or the next Steven Meisel. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It's out of your control, and it's awesome, and it's not a career path. </seg>
<seg id="41"> I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge, because unlike cardio-thoracic surgeons, it can just be distilled right into -- right now. </seg>
<seg id="42"> So if the photographer is right there and the light is right there, like a nice HMI, and the client says, "Cameron, we want a walking shot," well then this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward, the head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth, just do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends, 300, 400, 500 times. </seg>
<seg id="43"> It will look something like this. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle. </seg>
<seg id="45"> That was, I don't know what happened there. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Unfortunately after you've gone to school, and you have a résumé and you've done a few jobs, you can't say anything anymore, so if you say you want to be the President of the United States, but your résumé reads, "Underwear Model: 10 years," people give you a funny look. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The next question people always ask me is, "Do they retouch all the photos?" </seg>
<seg id="48"> And yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos, but that is only a small component of what's happening. </seg>
<seg id="49"> This picture is the very first picture that I ever took, and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini, and I didn't even have my period yet. </seg>
<seg id="50"> I know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl. </seg>
<seg id="51"> This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Here's me on the same day as this shoot. </seg>
<seg id="53"> My friend got to come with me. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine. </seg>
<seg id="56"> And here's me today. </seg>
<seg id="57"> And I hope what you're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me. </seg>
<seg id="58"> They are constructions, and they are constructions by a group of professionals, by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production, and they build this. That's not me. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Okay, so the next question people always ask me is, "Do you get free stuff?" </seg>
<seg id="60"> I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear, except for earlier, but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about. </seg>
<seg id="61"> I grew up in Cambridge, and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free. </seg>
<seg id="62"> When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course, we got pulled over, and all it took was a "Sorry, officer," and we were on our way. </seg>
<seg id="63"> And I got these free things because of how I look, not who I am, and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are. </seg>
<seg id="64"> I live in New York, and last year, of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked, 86 percent of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men. </seg>
<seg id="65"> And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of, "Will I get stopped?" </seg>
<seg id="66"> but "How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?" </seg>
<seg id="67"> When I was researching this talk, I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States, 53 percent don't like their bodies, and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they're 17. </seg>
<seg id="68"> So the last question people ask me is, "What is it like to be a model?" </seg>
<seg id="69"> And I think the answer that they're looking for is, "If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair, you will be so happy and fabulous." </seg>
<seg id="70"> And when we're backstage, we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that. </seg>
<seg id="71"> We say, "It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work with creative, inspired, passionate people." </seg>
<seg id="72"> And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story, because the thing that we never say on camera, that I have never said on camera, is, "I am insecure." </seg>
<seg id="73"> And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day. </seg>
<seg id="74"> And if you ever are wondering, "If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?" </seg>
<seg id="75"> you just need to meet a group of models, because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes, and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="76"> So when I was writing this talk, I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance, because on the one hand, I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say, "Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor," and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with, "and it doesn't always make me happy." </seg>
<seg id="77"> But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries. </seg>
<seg id="78"> But I'm also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it's great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career, because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job, or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college, which seems so important right now. </seg>
<seg id="79"> If there's a takeaway to this talk, I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures. </seg>
<seg id="80"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>In the wake of the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, mixed into the wreckage were lost and damaged photos of families and loved ones. Photo retoucher Becci Manson, together with local volunteers and a global group of colleagues she recruited online, helped clean and fix them, restoring those memories to their owners.</description>

<talkid>1532</talkid>
<title>Becci Manson: touching lives through photos</title>
<seg id="1"> Before March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher based in New York City. </seg>
<seg id="2"> We're pale, gray creatures. </seg>
<seg id="3"> We hide in dark, windowless rooms, and generally avoid sunlight. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect, and the impossible possible, and we get criticized in the press all the time, but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography. </seg>
<seg id="5"> On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest of the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Soon after, an organization I volunteer with, All Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days, working as part of the response efforts. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I, along with hundreds of other volunteers, knew we couldn't just sit at home, so I decided to join them for three weeks. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On May the 13th, I made my way to the town of Ōfunato. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture, about 50,000 people, one of the first that was hit by the wave. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height, and traveled over two miles inland. </seg>
<seg id="11"> As you can imagine, the town had been devastated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> We pulled debris from canals and ditches. </seg>
<seg id="13"> We cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation. </seg>
<seg id="14"> We cleared tons and tons of stinking, rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant. </seg>
<seg id="15"> We got dirty, and we loved it. </seg>
<seg id="16"> For weeks, all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things. </seg>
<seg id="17"> They'd been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards. </seg>
<seg id="18"> And everyone was doing the same. </seg>
<seg id="19"> They were collecting them up, and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Now, it wasn't until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt. </seg>
<seg id="21"> As they had run from the wave, and for their lives, absolutely everything they had, everything had to be left behind. </seg>
<seg id="22"> At the end of my first week there, I found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen, the huge giant bathtubs. </seg>
<seg id="24"> This happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This is where people were handing them in, and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand-cleaning them. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Now, it was emotional and it was inspiring, and I've always heard about thinking outside the box, but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened. </seg>
<seg id="27"> As I looked through the photos, there were some were over a hundred years old, some still in the envelope from the processing lab, I couldn't help but think as a retoucher that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch, and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same. </seg>
<seg id="28"> So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them, and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive, I knew we had to give it a go. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So we started retouching photos. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This was the very first. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl's face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Otherwise, that little girl isn't going to look like that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic as having the photo damaged. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Over time, more photos came in, thankfully, and more retouchers were needed, and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn, and within five days, 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Within two weeks, I had 150 people wanting to join in. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Within Japan, by July, we'd branched out to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata, further north to a town called Yamada. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up, where people were reclaiming their photos. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before, but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo, they could give it to us, have it scanned, uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded by a gaijin, a stranger, somewhere on the other side of the globe, and it'd start being fixed. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The time it took, however, to get it back is a completely different story, and it depended obviously on the damage involved. </seg>
<seg id="39"> It could take an hour. It could take weeks. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It could take months. </seg>
<seg id="41"> The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn, or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn't damaged. </seg>
<seg id="42"> It was very time-consuming. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Now, all these photos had been damaged by water, submerged in salt water, covered in bacteria, in sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time is going to continue to damage them, so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project. </seg>
<seg id="44"> We couldn't retouch the photo unless it was cleaned, dry and reclaimed. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Now, we were lucky with our hand-cleaning. </seg>
<seg id="46"> We had an amazing local woman who guided us. </seg>
<seg id="47"> It's very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos. </seg>
<seg id="48"> As my team leader Wynne once said, it's like doing a tattoo on someone. </seg>
<seg id="49"> You don't get a chance to mess it up. </seg>
<seg id="50"> The lady who brought us these photos was lucky, as far as the photos go. </seg>
<seg id="51"> She had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage. </seg>
<seg id="52"> She also had duplicates. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix, we could just put them together in one good photo, and remake the whole photo. </seg>
<seg id="54"> When she collected the photos from us, she shared a bit of her story with us. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Her photos were found by her husband's colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood, and they'd recognized him. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The day of the tsunami, he'd actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed. </seg>
<seg id="57"> He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Her two little boys, not so little anymore, but her two boys were both at school, separate schools. </seg>
<seg id="59"> One of them got caught up in the water. </seg>
<seg id="60"> It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son's 14th birthday. </seg>
<seg id="62"> For her, despite all of this, those photos were the perfect gift back to him, something he could look at again, something he remembered from before that wasn't still scarred from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed. </seg>
<seg id="63"> After six months in Japan, 1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands, hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean over 135,000 photographs, the large majority </seg>
<seg id="64"> a large majority of which did actually find their home again, importantly. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back, fully restored and retouched. </seg>
<seg id="66"> During this time, we hadn't really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials, most of which was printer inks. </seg>
<seg id="67"> We take photos constantly. </seg>
<seg id="68"> A photo is a reminder of someone or something, a place, a relationship, a loved one. </seg>
<seg id="69"> They're our memory-keepers and our histories, the last thing we would grab and the first thing you'd go back to look for. </seg>
<seg id="70"> That's all this project was about, about restoring those little bits of humanity, giving someone that connection back. </seg>
<seg id="71"> When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this, it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it. </seg>
<seg id="72"> The project's also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers. </seg>
<seg id="73"> For some of them, it's given them a connection to something bigger, giving something back, using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin. </seg>
<seg id="74"> I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them, Cindy, the day I finally got back from Japan after six months. </seg>
<seg id="75"> "As I worked, I couldn't help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images. </seg>
<seg id="76"> One in particular, a photo of women of all ages, from grandmother to little girl, gathered around a baby, struck a chord, because a similar photo from my family, my grandmother and mother, myself, and newborn daughter, hangs on our wall. </seg>
<seg id="77"> Across the globe, throughout the ages, our basic needs are just the same, aren't they?" </seg>
<seg id="78"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>In Libya, Zahra' Langhi was part of the "days of rage" movement that helped topple the dictator Qaddafi. But -- then what? In their first elections, Libyans tried an innovative slate of candidates, the "zipper ballot," that ensured equal representation from men and women of both sides. Yet the same gridlocked politics of dominance and exclusion won out. What Libya needs now, Langhi suggests, is collaboration, not competition; compassion, not rage.</description>

<talkid>1659</talkid>
<title>Zahra' Langhi: Why Libya's revolution didn't work -- and what might</title>
<seg id="1"> I have never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile: "Son, resist Gaddafi. Fight him. </seg>
<seg id="2"> But don't you ever turn into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out, inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions. </seg>
<seg id="4"> I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And there it was, a great revolution. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime, raising slogans of freedom, dignity, social justice. </seg>
<seg id="7"> They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Eventually, after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead, we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant. </seg>
<seg id="10"> However, Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden, a legacy of tyranny, corruption and seeds of diversions. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For four decades Gaddafi's tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Aware of the devastation and the challenges, I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society, calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi -- almost 300 in Tripoli. </seg>
<seg id="14"> After a period of 33 years in exile, I went back to Libya, and with unique enthusiasm, I started organizing workshops on capacity building, on human development of leadership skills. </seg>
<seg id="15"> With an amazing group of women, I co-founded the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace, a movement of women, leaders, from different walks of life, to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace. </seg>
<seg id="16"> I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections, an environment which was increasingly polarized, an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion. </seg>
<seg id="17"> I led an initiative by the Libyan Women's Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law, a law that would give every citizen, no matter what your background, the right to vote and run, and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists, creating the zipper list. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Eventually, our initiative was adopted and successful. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years. </seg>
<seg id="20"> However, bit by bit, the euphoria of the elections, and of the revolution as a whole, was fading out -- for every day we were waking up to the news of violence. </seg>
<seg id="21"> One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate. </seg>
<seg id="23"> On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And every day, every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Our society, shaped by a revolutionary mindset, became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom, dignity, social justice -- that we first held. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Intolerance, exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [aftermath] of the revolution. </seg>
<seg id="27"> I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice, made the wrong decision. </seg>
<seg id="29"> We did not prioritize right. </seg>
<seg id="30"> For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation? </seg>
<seg id="32"> No, it didn't. </seg>
<seg id="33"> What is it, then? </seg>
<seg id="34"> Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion, by both men and women? </seg>
<seg id="35"> Maybe what was missing was not the women only, but the feminine values of compassion, mercy and inclusion. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections, which only reinforced polarization and division. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical, quantitative representation of the feminine. </seg>
<seg id="38"> We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage. </seg>
<seg id="39"> We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy. </seg>
<seg id="40"> We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge, collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of exclusion. </seg>
<seg id="41"> These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace. </seg>
<seg id="42"> For peace has an alchemy, and this alchemy is about the intertwining, the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives. </seg>
<seg id="43"> That's the real zipper. </seg>
<seg id="44"> And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically. </seg>
<seg id="45"> According to a Quranic verse "Salam" -- peace -- "is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem." </seg>
<seg id="46"> In turn, the word "raheem," which is known in all Abrahamic traditions, has the same root in Arabic as the word "rahem" -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female, from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from. </seg>
<seg id="47"> And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it, the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Thus we are told that "My mercy encompasses all things." </seg>
<seg id="49"> Thus we are told that "My mercy takes precedence over my anger." </seg>
<seg id="50"> May we all be granted a grace of mercy. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>As a child growing up in North Korea, Hyeonseo Lee thought her country was "the best on the planet." It wasn't until the famine of the 90s that she began to wonder. She escaped the country at 14, to begin a life in hiding, as a refugee in China. Hers is a harrowing, personal tale of survival and hope -- and a powerful reminder of those who face constant danger, even when the border is far behind.</description>

<title>Hyeonseo Lee: My escape from North Korea</title>
<seg id="1"> When I was little, I thought my country was the best on the planet, and I grew up singing a song called "Nothing To Envy." </seg>
<seg id="2"> And I was very proud. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In school, we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung, but we never learned much about the outside world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Although I often wondered about the outside world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything suddenly changed. </seg>
<seg id="5"> When I was seven years old, I saw my first public execution, but I thought my life in North Korea was normal. </seg>
<seg id="6"> My family was not poor, and myself, I had never experienced hunger. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from a coworker's sister. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It read, "When you read this, all five family members will not exist in this world, because we haven't eaten for the past two weeks. </seg>
<seg id="9"> We are lying on the floor together, and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die." </seg>
<seg id="10"> I was so shocked. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Soon after, when I was walking past a train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase from my memory. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A lifeless woman was lying on the ground, while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother's face. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But nobody helped them, because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Ultimately, more than a million North Koreans died during the famine, and many only survived by eating grass, bugs and tree bark. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Power outages also became more and more frequent, so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China, just across the river from my home. </seg>
<seg id="18"> I always wondered why they had lights but we didn't. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This is the Amrok River, which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China. </seg>
<seg id="21"> As you can see, the river can be very narrow at certain points, allowing North Koreans to secretly cross. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But many die. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Sometimes, I saw dead bodies floating down the river. </seg>
<seg id="24"> I can't reveal many details [about] how I left North Korea, but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time. </seg>
<seg id="26"> I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together. </seg>
<seg id="27"> In China, it was hard living as a young girl without my family. </seg>
<seg id="28"> I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee, but I soon learned it's not only extremely difficult, it's also very dangerous, since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed, and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea. </seg>
<seg id="30"> One day, my worst nightmare came true, when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Someone had accused me of being North Korean, so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions. </seg>
<seg id="32"> I was so scared, I thought my heart was going to explode. </seg>
<seg id="33"> If anything seemed unnatural, I could be imprisoned and repatriated. </seg>
<seg id="34"> I thought my life was over, but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions. </seg>
<seg id="35"> After they finished questioning me, one official said to another, "This was a false report. </seg>
<seg id="36"> She's not North Korean." </seg>
<seg id="37"> And they let me go. It was a miracle. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies, but many can be caught by the Chinese police and repatriated. </seg>
<seg id="39"> These girls were so lucky. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Even though they were caught, they were eventually released after heavy international pressure. </seg>
<seg id="41"> These North Koreans were not so lucky. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Every year, countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea, where they can be tortured, imprisoned or publicly executed. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Even though I was really fortunate to get out, many other North Koreans have not been so lucky. </seg>
<seg id="44"> It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Even after learning a new language and getting a job, their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant. </seg>
<seg id="46"> That's why, after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk going to South Korea, and I started a new life yet again. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected. </seg>
<seg id="48"> English was so important in South Korea, so I had to start learning my third language. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Also, I realized there was a wide gap between North and South. </seg>
<seg id="50"> We are all Korean, but inside, we have become very different due to 67 years of division. </seg>
<seg id="51"> I even went through an identity crisis. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Am I South Korean or North Korean? </seg>
<seg id="53"> Where am I from? Who am I? </seg>
<seg id="54"> Suddenly, there was no country I could proudly call my own. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. </seg>
<seg id="56"> I started studying for the university entrance exam. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Just as I was starting to get used to my new life, I received a shocking phone call. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family, and, as a punishment, my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside. </seg>
<seg id="59"> They had to get out quickly, so I started planning how to help them escape. </seg>
<seg id="60"> North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom. </seg>
<seg id="61"> It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, so, ironically, I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to guide them, somehow, through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia. </seg>
<seg id="63"> The journey by bus took one week, and we were almost caught several times. </seg>
<seg id="64"> One time, our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer. </seg>
<seg id="65"> He took everyone's I.D. cards, and he started asking them questions. </seg>
<seg id="66"> Since my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested. </seg>
<seg id="67"> As the Chinese officer approached my family, I impulsively stood up, and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning. </seg>
<seg id="68"> He looked at me suspiciously, but luckily he believed me. </seg>
<seg id="69"> We made it all the way to the border of Laos, but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos. </seg>
<seg id="70"> But even after we got past the border, my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing. </seg>
<seg id="71"> After I paid the fine and bribe, my family was released in one month, but soon after, my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of Laos. </seg>
<seg id="72"> This was one of the lowest points in my life. </seg>
<seg id="73"> I did everything to get my family to freedom, and we came so close, but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy. </seg>
<seg id="74"> I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to get my family out, but I didn't have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore. </seg>
<seg id="75"> I lost all hope. </seg>
<seg id="76"> At that moment, I heard one man's voice ask me, "What's wrong?" </seg>
<seg id="77"> I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask. </seg>
<seg id="78"> In my broken English, and with a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without hesitating, the man went to the ATM and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail. </seg>
<seg id="79"> I thanked him with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why are you helping me?" </seg>
<seg id="80"> "I'm not helping you," he said. </seg>
<seg id="81"> "I'm helping the North Korean people." </seg>
<seg id="82"> I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life. </seg>
<seg id="83"> The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most, and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need. </seg>
<seg id="84"> Eventually, after our long journey, my family and I were reunited in South Korea, but getting to freedom is only half the battle. </seg>
<seg id="85"> Many North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they arrive in a new country, they start with little or no money. </seg>
<seg id="86"> So we can benefit from the international community for education, English language training, job training, and more. </seg>
<seg id="87"> We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world, because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside. </seg>
<seg id="88"> I've been so lucky, received so much help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support. </seg>
<seg id="89"> I'm confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world, including the TED stage. </seg>
<seg id="90"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>As natural garbage collectors, vultures are vital to our ecosystem -- so why all the bad press? Why are so many in danger of extinction? Raptor biologist Munir Virani says we need to pay more attention to these unique and misunderstood creatures, to change our perception and save the vultures.</description>
<keywords>adventure,animals,biology,birds,nature,science</keywords>
<talkid>1610</talkid>
<title>Munir Virani: Why I love vultures</title>
<seg id="1"> I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals. </seg>
<seg id="2"> There are 10,000 species of birds in the world. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds. </seg>
<seg id="4"> When you see a vulture like this, the first thing that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly, greedy creatures that are just after your flesh, associated with politicians. </seg>
<seg id="5"> I want to change that perception. I want to change those feelings you have for these birds, because they need our sympathy. They really do. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And I'll tell you why. </seg>
<seg id="7"> First of all, why do they have such a bad press? </seg>
<seg id="8"> When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832 on the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture, and he said, "These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity." </seg>
<seg id="9"> You could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin. </seg>
<seg id="10"> You know, he changed his mind when he came back, and I'll tell you why. </seg>
<seg id="11"> They've also be associated with Disney — — personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters. </seg>
<seg id="12"> More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press — — these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that. </seg>
<seg id="13"> I want to challenge that. Do you know why? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Because MPs do not keep the environment clean. </seg>
<seg id="15"> MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases. </seg>
<seg id="16"> They are hardly monogamous. </seg>
<seg id="17"> They are far from being extinct. </seg>
<seg id="18"> And, my favorite is, vultures are better looking. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So there's two types of vultures in this planet. </seg>
<seg id="20"> There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras, and then the Old World vultures, where we have 16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction. </seg>
<seg id="21"> So why are vultures important? First of all, they provide vital ecological services. They clean up. </seg>
<seg id="22"> They're our natural garbage collectors. </seg>
<seg id="23"> They clean up carcasses right to the bone. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose, and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Vultures also have tremendous historical significance. </seg>
<seg id="27"> They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood, and together with the cobra, symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god, and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the 10-headed demon Ravana. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important sky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places to bury the dead, or wood to cremate them, so these vultures provide a natural disposal system. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So what is the problem with vultures? </seg>
<seg id="32"> We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya, of which six are highly threatened with extinction. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason that they're getting poisoned is because there's human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators, and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this. </seg>
<seg id="34"> In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered, which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct, and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac. </seg>
<seg id="35"> This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India, and they have taken a stand. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites, and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb of rabies. The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa: 353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana. </seg>
<seg id="38"> I am not against wind energy, but we need to work with the governments, because wind turbines do this to birds. They slice them in half. </seg>
<seg id="39"> They are bird-blending machines. </seg>
<seg id="40"> In West Africa, there's a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market. </seg>
<seg id="41"> So what's being done? Well, we're conducting research on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them. </seg>
<seg id="42"> We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go. </seg>
<seg id="43"> We can see that they travel different countries, so if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you. </seg>
<seg id="44"> We need to work with governments in regional levels. </seg>
<seg id="45"> We're working with local communities. </seg>
<seg id="46"> We're talking to them about appreciating vultures, about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide. </seg>
<seg id="47"> How can you help? You can become active, make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time to spread the word. Spread the word. </seg>
<seg id="48"> When you walk out of this room, you will be informed about vultures, but speak to your families, to your children, to your neighbors about vultures. </seg>
<seg id="49"> They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species. </seg>
<seg id="51"> Thank you very much. </seg>

<description>Faith Jegede tells the moving and funny story of growing up with her two brothers, both autistic -- and both extraordinary. In this talk from the TED Talent Search, she reminds us to pursue a life beyond what is normal.</description>
<keywords>brain,culture,mental health,storytelling</keywords>
<talkid>1600</talkid>
<title>Faith Jegede: What I've learned from my autistic brothers</title>
<seg id="1"> Today I have just one request. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Please don't tell me I'm normal. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Remi is 22, tall and very handsome. </seg>
<seg id="5"> He's speechless, but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Remi knows what love is. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless. </seg>
<seg id="8"> He's not greedy. He doesn't see skin color. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He doesn't care about religious differences, and get this: He has never told a lie. </seg>
<seg id="10"> When he sings songs from our childhood, attempting words that not even I could remember, he reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind, and how wonderful the unknown must be. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Samuel is 16. He's tall. He's very handsome. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He has the most impeccable memory. </seg>
<seg id="13"> He has a selective one, though. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He doesn't remember if he stole my chocolate bar, but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod, conversations we had when he was four, weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies, and Lady Gaga's birthday. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Don't they sound incredible? </seg>
<seg id="16"> But most people don't agree. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And in fact, because their minds don't fit into society's version of normal, they're often bypassed and misunderstood. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case, although they were not seen as ordinary, this could only mean one thing: that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now, for you who may be less familiar with the term "autism," it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes physical skills. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It manifests in each individual differently, hence why Remi is so different from Sam. </seg>
<seg id="21"> And across the world, every 20 minutes, one new person is diagnosed with autism, and although it's one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world, there is no known cause or cure. </seg>
<seg id="22"> And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism, but I cannot recall a day without it. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I was just three years old when my brother came along, and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And after a few months went by, I realized that he was different. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He screamed a lot. </seg>
<seg id="26"> He didn't want to play like the other babies did, and in fact, he didn't seem very interested in me whatsoever. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Remi lived and reigned in his own world, with his own rules, and he found pleasure in the smallest things, like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And as he grew older, he grew more different, and the differences became more obvious. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never-ending hyperactivity was something really unique: a pure and innocent nature, a boy who saw the world without prejudice, a human who had never lied. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="31"> Now, I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family, moments where I've wished that they were just like me. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But I cast my mind back to the things that they've taught me about individuality and communication and love, and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change with normality. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us, and the fact that we are different doesn't mean that one of us is wrong. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It just means that there's a different kind of right. </seg>
<seg id="35"> And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you, it would be that you don't have to be normal. </seg>
<seg id="36"> You can be extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Because autistic or not, the differences that we have -- We've got a gift! Everyone's got a gift inside of us, and in all honesty, the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The chance for greatness, for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Please -- don't tell me I'm normal. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>Ramesh Raskar presents femto-photography, a new type of imaging so fast it visualizes the world one trillion frames per second, so detailed it shows light itself in motion. This technology may someday be used to build cameras that can look "around" corners or see inside the body without X-rays.</description>

<talkid>1520</talkid>
<title>Ramesh Raskar: Imaging at a trillion frames per second</title>
<seg id="1"> Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple, and exposure just a millionth of a second. </seg>
<seg id="2"> But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million, or a billion, but one trillion frames per second. </seg>
<seg id="3"> I present you a new type of photography, femto-photography, a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners, beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X-ray, and really challenge what we mean by a camera. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second -- which is several femtoseconds -- I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide, and that packet of photons, that bullet, will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Now, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle, how will those photons shatter into this bottle? </seg>
<seg id="7"> How does light look in slow motion? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Now, the whole event </seg>
<seg id="9"> Now, remember, the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond — that's how much time it takes for light to travel — but I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But, Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Now, there's a lot going on in this movie, so let me break this down and show you what's going on. </seg>
<seg id="12"> So, the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet, with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Some of the light leaks, goes on the table, and you start seeing these ripples of waves. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions. </seg>
<seg id="15"> As you can see, there's a bubble of air, and it's bouncing around inside. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Meanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table, and because of the reflections at the top, you see at the back of the bottle, after several frames, the reflections are focused. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Now, if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion, do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie? </seg>
<seg id="18"> A day, a week? Actually, a whole year. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It'll be a very boring movie — — of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And what about some still-life photography? </seg>
<seg id="21"> You can watch the ripples again washing over the table, the tomato and the wall in the back. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water. </seg>
<seg id="23"> I thought, this is how nature paints a photo, one femto frame at a time, but of course our eye sees an integral composite. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But if you look at this tomato one more time, you will notice, as the light washes over the tomato, it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Why is that? Because the tomato is actually ripe, and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato, and it comes out after several trillionths of a second. </seg>
<seg id="26"> So, in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone, you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it. </seg>
<seg id="27"> So how did my team at MIT create this camera? </seg>
<seg id="28"> Now, as photographers, you know, if you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light, but we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure, so you're going to get hardly any light. </seg>
<seg id="29"> So, what we do is we send that bullet, those packet of photons, millions of times, and record again and again with very clever synchronization, and from the gigabytes of data, we computationally weave together to create those femto-videos I showed you. </seg>
<seg id="30"> And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways. </seg>
<seg id="31"> So, Superman can fly. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Some other heroes can become invisible, but what about a new power for a future superhero: to see around corners? </seg>
<seg id="33"> The idea is that we could shine some light on the door. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It's going to bounce, go inside the room, some of that is going to reflect back on the door, and then back to the camera, and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light. </seg>
<seg id="35"> And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it. </seg>
<seg id="36"> On the left, you see our femto-camera. </seg>
<seg id="37"> There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall, and we're going to bounce light off the door. </seg>
<seg id="38"> So after our paper was published in Nature Communications, it was highlighted by Nature.com, and they created this animation. </seg>
<seg id="39"> We're going to fire those bullets of light, and they're going to hit this wall, and because the packet of the photons, they will scatter in all the directions, and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin, which in turn will again scatter that light, and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light, and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera, but most interestingly, they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And because we have a camera that can run so fast, our femto-camera, it has some unique abilities. </seg>
<seg id="41"> It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light. </seg>
<seg id="42"> And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door, but also to the hidden objects, but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance. </seg>
<seg id="43"> By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo, which, you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense, but then we will take a lot of such pictures, dozens of such pictures, put them together, and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light, and from that, can we see the hidden object? </seg>
<seg id="44"> Can we see it in full 3D? </seg>
<seg id="45"> So this is our reconstruction. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road, but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend, or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows, or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders, and also for cardioscopes. </seg>
<seg id="47"> But of course, because of tissue and blood, this is quite challenging, so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto-photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Now, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself, science became art, an art of ultra-fast photography, and I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging, but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time-lapse and color-coding, and we look at those ripples. Remember, the time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second. </seg>
<seg id="49"> But there's also something funny going on here. </seg>
<seg id="50"> When you look at the ripples under the cap, the ripples are moving away from us. </seg>
<seg id="51"> The ripples should be moving towards us. </seg>
<seg id="52"> What's going on here? </seg>
<seg id="53"> It turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light, we have strange effects, and Einstein would have loved to see this picture. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order, so by applying the corresponding space and time warp, we can correct for this distortion. </seg>
<seg id="55"> So whether it's for photography around corners, or creating the next generation of health imaging, or creating new visualizations, since our invention, we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website, and our hope is that the DIY, the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras — — and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging. </seg>
<seg id="56"> It's about time. Thank you. </seg>

<description>Parkinson's disease affects 6.3 million people worldwide, causing weakness and tremors, but there's no objective way to detect it early on. Yet. Applied mathematician and TED Fellow Max Little is testing a simple, cheap tool that in trials is able to detect Parkinson's with 99 percent accuracy -- in a 30-second phone call.</description>
<keywords>disease,global issues,innovation,math,medicine,science,technology</keywords>
<talkid>1534</talkid>
<title> A test for Parkinson's with a phone call</title>
<seg id="1"> So, well, I do applied math, and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math, is that we are like management consultants. </seg>
<seg id="2"> No one knows what the hell we do. </seg>
<seg id="3"> So I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do. </seg>
<seg id="4"> So, dancing is one of the most human of activities. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill, and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability, as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time. </seg>
<seg id="8"> So great progress and treatment has been made over the years. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease, and they have to live with incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease, so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it's too late. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We need to be able to measure progression objectively, and ultimately, the only way we're going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure. </seg>
<seg id="11"> But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers, so there's no simple blood test that you can do, and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test. </seg>
<seg id="12"> You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, it's just never done. It's never done. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But what if patients could do this test at home? </seg>
<seg id="14"> Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic, and what if patients could do that test themselves, right? </seg>
<seg id="15"> No expensive staff time required. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Takes about $300, by the way, in the neurologist's clinic to do it. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this, because, you see, in one sense, at least, we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds, and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers, because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds, and we all actually have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training. </seg>
<seg id="21"> I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak. </seg>
<seg id="22"> From the sound, we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates, and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's, so too are the vocal organs. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor. </seg>
<seg id="24"> We see all the same symptoms. </seg>
<seg id="25"> We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it. </seg>
<seg id="27"> So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle, in some cases, but with any digital microphone, and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning, which is very advanced by now, we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone. </seg>
<seg id="28"> So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure. </seg>
<seg id="30"> You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition, voice-based tests are non-expert. </seg>
<seg id="32"> That means they can be self-administered. </seg>
<seg id="33"> They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most. </seg>
<seg id="34"> They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens. </seg>
<seg id="35"> When something becomes ultra-low cost, it becomes massively scalable. </seg>
<seg id="36"> So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now. </seg>
<seg id="37"> We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients. </seg>
<seg id="38"> No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup. </seg>
<seg id="39"> We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data. </seg>
<seg id="40"> We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials, and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="41"> We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late. </seg>
<seg id="42"> So, taking the first steps towards this today, we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative. </seg>
<seg id="43"> With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals. </seg>
<seg id="44"> We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply, and leave recordings, a few cents each, and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="47"> So Max, by taking all these samples of, let's say, 10,000 people, you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not? </seg>
<seg id="48"> What are you going to get out of those samples? </seg>
<seg id="49"> Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that, during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not, you see. Right. </seg>
<seg id="50"> You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances, and it's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors, and looking for the actual markers of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="52"> So you're 86 percent accurate right now? </seg>
<seg id="53"> It's much better than that. </seg>
<seg id="54"> Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him, because he's done some fantastic work, and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well, which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy. </seg>
<seg id="55"> Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement. </seg>
<seg id="56"> So what that means is that people will be able to — People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in, record their voice, and then their doctor can check up on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Absolutely. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody. </seg>
<seg id="59"> Thanks, Tom. </seg>

<description>In her New Orleans neighborhood, artist and TED Fellow Candy Chang turned an abandoned house into a giant chalkboard asking a fill-in-the-blank question: "Before I die I want to ___." Her neighbors' answers -- surprising, poignant, funny -- became an unexpected mirror for the community. </description>

<title>Candy Chang: Before I die I want to...</title>
<seg id="1"> There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives. </seg>
<seg id="2"> We don't bump into every neighbor, so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on, though we do share the same public spaces. </seg>
<seg id="3"> So over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space, using simple tools like stickers, stencils and chalk. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And these projects came from questions I had, like, how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments? </seg>
<seg id="5"> How can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time? </seg>
<seg id="6"> How can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings, and gain a better understanding of our landscape? </seg>
<seg id="7"> And how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts, so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today? </seg>
<seg id="8"> Now, I live in New Orleans, and I am in love with New Orleans. </seg>
<seg id="9"> My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees, shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years, and I trust a city that always makes way for music. </seg>
<seg id="10"> I feel like every time someone sneezes, New Orleans has a parade. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America. </seg>
<seg id="12"> I live near this house, and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood, and I also thought about something that changed my life forever. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Her name was Joan, and she was a mother to me, and her death was sudden and unexpected. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And I thought about death a lot, and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had, and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life. </seg>
<seg id="17"> I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day, and forget what really matters to you. </seg>
<seg id="18"> So with help from old and new friends, I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence: "Before I die, I want to ... " So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk, reflect on their lives, and share their personal aspirations in public space. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I didn't know what to expect from this experiment, but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out, and it kept growing. </seg>
<seg id="20"> And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "Before I die, I want to be tried for piracy." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "Before I die, I want to straddle the International Date Line." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "Before I die, I want to sing for millions." </seg>
<seg id="24"> "Before I die, I want to plant a tree." </seg>
<seg id="25"> "Before I die, I want to live off the grid." </seg>
<seg id="26"> "Before I die, I want to hold her one more time." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "Before I die, I want to be someone's cavalry." </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Before I die, I want to be completely myself." </seg>
<seg id="29"> So this neglected space became a constructive one, and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud, tear up, and they consoled me during my own tough times. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It's about knowing you're not alone. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It's about making space for reflection and contemplation, and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change. </seg>
<seg id="33"> I made this last year, and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community, so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit, and now walls have been made in countries around the world, including Kazakhstan, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Together, we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we're given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In our age of increasing distractions, it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about or even think about, but I've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Thinking about death clarifies your life. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community, and with more ways to share our hopes, fears and stories, the people around us can not only help us make better places, they can help us lead better lives. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Thank you. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Thank you. </seg>

<description>In the Masai community where 13-year-old Richard Turere lives, cattle are all-important. But lion attacks were growing more frequent. In this short, inspiring talk, the young inventor shares the solar-powered solution he designed to safely scare the lions away.</description>
<keywords>agriculture,biodiversity,technology</keywords>
<talkid>1699</talkid>
<title> My invention that made peace with lions</title>
<seg id="1"> This is where I live. I live in Kenya, at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park. </seg>
<seg id="2"> Those are my dad's cows at the back, and behind the cows, that's the Nairobi National Park. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely, which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely. </seg>
<seg id="4"> So predators like lions follow them, and this is what they do. </seg>
<seg id="5"> They kill our livestock. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is one of the cows which was killed at night, and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead, and I felt so bad, because it was the only bull we had. </seg>
<seg id="7"> My community, the Maasai, we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them, and that's why we value them so much. </seg>
<seg id="8"> So I grew up hating lions so much. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock, and they're also upset about this problem. </seg>
<seg id="10"> So they kill the lions. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few. </seg>
<seg id="13"> So a boy, from six to nine years old, in my community is responsible for his dad's cows, and that's the same thing which happened to me. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So I had to find a way of solving this problem. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And the first idea I got was to use fire, because I thought lions were scared of fire. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But I came to realize that that didn't really help, because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed. </seg>
<seg id="17"> So I didn't give up. I continued. </seg>
<seg id="18"> And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow. </seg>
<seg id="19"> I was trying to trick the lions [into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But lions are very clever. </seg>
<seg id="21"> They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back, but the second day, they'll come and they say, this thing is not moving here, it's always here. </seg>
<seg id="22"> So he jumps in and kills the animals. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch, and that day, the lions didn't come. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So I had an idea. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Since I was a small boy, I used to work in my room for the whole day, and I even took apart my mom's new radio, and that day she almost killed me, but I learned a lot about electronics. </seg>
<seg id="27"> So I got an old car battery, an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle, and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off. </seg>
<seg id="29"> And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight. </seg>
<seg id="30"> So I set up everything. </seg>
<seg id="31"> As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery, and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer. </seg>
<seg id="32"> And the indicator box makes the lights flash. </seg>
<seg id="33"> As you can see, the bulbs face outside, because that's where the lions come from. </seg>
<seg id="34"> And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed, but I was sleeping in my bed. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Thanks. </seg>
<seg id="37"> So I set it up in my home two years ago, and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions. </seg>
<seg id="38"> And my neighboring homes heard about this idea. </seg>
<seg id="39"> One of them was this grandmother. </seg>
<seg id="40"> She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions, and she asked me if I could put the lights for her. </seg>
<seg id="41"> And I said, "Yes." </seg>
<seg id="42"> So I put the lights. You can see at the back, those are the lion lights. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community, and they're really working. </seg>
<seg id="44"> And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas, leopards, and it's also being used to scare elephants away from people's farms. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Because of this invention, I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, Brookhouse International School, and I'm really excited about this. </seg>
<seg id="46"> My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness. </seg>
<seg id="47"> I even took my friends back to my community, and we're installing the lights to the homes which don't have [any], and I'm teaching them how to put them. </seg>
<seg id="48"> So one year ago, I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father's cows, and I used to see planes flying over, and I told myself that one day, I'll be there inside. </seg>
<seg id="49"> And here I am today. </seg>
<seg id="50"> I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED. </seg>
<seg id="51"> So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up. </seg>
<seg id="52"> I used to hate lions, but now because my invention is saving my father's cows and the lions, we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Ashê olên. It means in my language, thank you very much. </seg>
<seg id="54"> You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours. </seg>
<seg id="55"> So you got this scholarship. Yep. </seg>
<seg id="56"> You're working on other electrical inventions. </seg>
<seg id="57"> What's the next one on your list? </seg>
<seg id="58"> My next invention is, I want to make an electric fence. Electric fence? </seg>
<seg id="59"> But I know electric fences are already invented, but I want to make mine. </seg>
<seg id="60"> You already tried it once, right, and you -- I tried it before, but I stopped because it gave me a shock. </seg>
<seg id="61"> In the trenches. Richard Turere, you are something else. </seg>
<seg id="62"> We're going to cheer you on every step of the way, my friend. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Thank you so much. Thank you. </seg>

<description>A long time ago in New York City, Steve Addis stood on a corner holding his 1-year-old daughter in his arms; his wife snapped a photo. The image has inspired an annual father-daughter ritual, where Addis and his daughter pose for the same picture, on the same corner, each year. Addis shares 15 treasured photographs from the series, and explores why this small, repeated ritual means so much.</description>

<title>Steven Addis: A father-daughter bond, one photo at a time</title>
<seg id="1"> Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera, but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine, and I didn't take any of them. </seg>
<seg id="2"> There were no art directors, no stylists, no chance for reshoots, not even any regard for lighting. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In fact, most of them were taken by random tourists. </seg>
<seg id="4"> My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement, and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday. We're on the corner of 57th and 5th. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later, so we decided to take the same picture. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Well you can see where this is going. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Approaching my daughter's third birthday, my wife said, "Hey, why don't you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip, and continue the ritual?" </seg>
<seg id="8"> This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture. </seg>
<seg id="9"> You know, it's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger. </seg>
<seg id="10"> No one's ever refused, and luckily no one's ever run off with our camera. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Back then, we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It's really become sacred to us. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This one was taken just weeks after 9/11, and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand. </seg>
<seg id="14"> So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment, or even a specific trip. </seg>
<seg id="15"> They're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year, and not just physically, but in every way. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Because while we take the same photo, our perspectives change, and she reaches new milestones, and I get to see life through her eyes, and how she interacts with and sees everything. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Recently, on one trip, we were walking, and she stops dead in her tracks, and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot. </seg>
<seg id="20"> She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier. </seg>
<seg id="21"> And now what she's looking at in New York are colleges, because she's determined to go to school in New York. </seg>
<seg id="22"> And it hit me: One of the most important things we all make are memories. </seg>
<seg id="23"> So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories. </seg>
<seg id="24"> I don't know about you, but aside from these 15 shots, I'm not in many of the family photos. </seg>
<seg id="25"> I'm always the one taking the picture. </seg>
<seg id="26"> So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot, and don't hesitate to go up to someone and ask, "Will you take our picture?" </seg>
<seg id="27"> Thank you. </seg>
