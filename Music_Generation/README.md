# Music Generation

Given sample MIDI music files, generate new MIDI music files using an LSTM based approach.

## Usage

Run the code with `python createmusic.py` and wait for it to complete at least a 100 iterations.

## Samples

A few generated samples are included in the 'samples/Test1' and 'samples/Test2' folders.
